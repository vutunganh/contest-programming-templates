//  triangles
//  2. A triangle with base b and height h has area A=0.5×b×h.
//  3. A triangle with three sides: a, b, c has perimeter p = a + b + c and semi-perimeter
//  s = 0.5 × p.
//  4. A triangle with 3 sides: a, b, c and semi-perimeter s has area
//     A = sqrt(s × (s − a) × (s − b) × (s − c)). This formula is called the Heron’s Formula.
//  5. A triangle with area A and semi-perimeter s has an inscribed circle (incircle) with
//     radius r = A/s.

//   quadrilaterals
//  1. Quadrilateral or Quadrangle is a polygon with four edges (and four vertices). The term ‘polygon’ itself is described in more details below (Section 7.3).
//  Figure 7.7 shows a few examples of Quadrilateral objects.
//  2. Rectangle is a polygon with four edges, four vertices, and four right angles.
//  3. A rectangle with width w and height h has area A = w × h and perimeter p =
//  2×(w+h).
//  4. Square is a special case of a rectangle where w = h.
//  5. Trapezium is a polygon with four edges, four vertices, and one pair of parallel edges. If the two non-parallel sides have the same length, we have an Isosceles Trapezium.
//  6. A trapezium with a pair of parallel edges of lengths w1 and w2; and a height h between both parallel edges has area A = 0.5 × (w1 + w2) × h.
//  7. Parallelogram is a polygon with four edges and four vertices. Moreover, the opposite sides must be parallel.
//  8. Kite is a quadrilateral which has two pairs of sides of the same length which are adjacent to each other. The area of a kite is diagonal1 × diagonal2/2.
//  9. Rhombus is a special parallelogram where every side has equal length. It is also a special case of kite where every side has equal length.
